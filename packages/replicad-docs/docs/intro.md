# Introduction

replicad is a library to build browser based 3D models with code.

In the fashion of code cad, it allows you to build 3D models with code.

But, unless most CAD offerings, replicad is a library first. As an abstraction
over opencascade, it gives developers the power to integrate it in their web
application.

So there are two ways you might be interested in this library:

- how do I use it to build a 3D model?
- how do I integrate replicad in my web application?

## Building a 3D model

As of now, there is only a simple online visualiser to play with the replicad
API and draw a 3D model.

You can use [the visualiser](https://studio.replicad.xyz/visualiser) to follow [the
tutorial](/docs/tutorial-basics/using-the-visualiser)

## Integrating replicad in your web application

The tools to do this are still in the process of being cleaned up to be shared
in this project.

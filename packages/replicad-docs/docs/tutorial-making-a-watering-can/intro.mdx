Do you like to follow step to learn? This tutorial is for you - it allows you
to build this plunge watering can by using the replicad APIs.

<iframe allow="fullscreen" src={iframePath("watering-can.js")}></iframe>

Note that this model is inspired by by [Robert
Bronwasser](https://www.robertbronwasser.com/project/spring/) watering can. The
original implementation [comes from our
community](https://github.com/sgenoud/replicad/discussions/35).
